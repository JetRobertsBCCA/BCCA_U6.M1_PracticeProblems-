# Book Haven - Library Management Project

## Overview
Welcome to **Book Haven**, a beginner-friendly Django project designed to help you learn how to manage a simple library system. In this project, you will create models for books and authors, implement functions to manipulate them, and write tests to ensure everything works correctly.

## Testing

Write comprehensive tests for the following:

1. **`create_author`**:
   - Verify the `Author` instance is created correctly.
   - Handle edge cases like missing or invalid input.

2. **`create_book`**:
   - Ensure a `Book` instance is created with the correct attributes.
   - Verify the `ForeignKey` relationship to the `Author` model.

3. **`list_books_by_author`**:
   - Confirm that all books by the specified author are returned.
   - Test behavior for authors with no books.

4. **`longest_book`**:
   - Verify the function correctly identifies the book with the most pages.
   - Handle edge cases such as no books in the database.

## Additional Tips

- Use Djangoâ€™s `TestCase` to write your tests.
- Test edge cases thoroughly, such as missing or invalid input.
- Ensure the database relationships are working as expected.
